# `hyperfine`

`hyperfine` is a Python package providing miscellaneous tools to aid in
materials science studies using implanted-ion nuclear-decay spin probes,
such as [μSR] and [β-NMR].
The package's content/functionality largely reflect my own scientific interests,
as well as my current academic projects (see my [Google Scholar profile]);
however, my hope is that some of the utilities will be useful for you too!

## Installing

From the repository:
```bash
python3 -m pip install . --user

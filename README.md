# `hyperfine`

`hyperfine` is a Python package providing miscellaneous tools to aid in
materials science studies using implanted-ion nuclear-decay spin probes,
such as [μSR] and [β-NMR].
The package's content and functionality largely reflect my scientific interests,
as well as the recent academic projects I've worked on
(see, e.g., my [Google Scholar profile]).
My hope is that some of the utilities implemented here will be useful for you,
too!

## Installing
